Goals of the algorithm

Inputs: An .rtf file with the following information:
    - Line number: the order number of the line
    - Timespan: time range when the speaker was talking
    - Content: What the speaker said
    - Date: The date at which the conversation was
    - Time: The time of day the converstation took place
    - Speaker: The name of the speaker
    - Recipient: Who the speaker was talking to. (labeled "all" if directed at everyone in the group)
    - Starts At:

There is an example input .rtf file located on the team GitHub page.

        + used to characterize documents where the catagories are found within the document as opposed to just positive and negative
        + The goal is to give insight about what information is in the document

        + Text class is very useful giving information about a text such as word count, and basic statistics
            *Note that it works on a document as a whole. If we wanted to use it we would have to create a
            text document for each speaker.
Outputs
    - A line graphs that shows the positive, negative and neutral sentiment rating of each individual speaker
    - "focus points" that show key points in the conversation. For example, the point when a speaker changes moods.
    - A comparison line graph the show the difference in the emotions of the speakers. We could classify the sentiment
    scores of the conversation based on the difference between each of the individual speaker's
    positive, negative and neutral scores. The closer the sentiment scores are to each other, the more the
    conversation would reflect the corresponding emotion.
    - number of words
    - frequency of words
