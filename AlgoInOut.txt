Outputs
    - A line graphs that shows the positive, negative and neutral sentiment rating of each individual speaker
    - "focus points" that show key points in the conversation. For example, the point when a speaker changes moods.
    - A comparison line graph the show the difference in the moods of the speakers. We could classify the sentiment
    scores of the conversation based on the difference between each of the individual speaker's
    positive, negative and neutral scores. The closer the sentiment scores are to each other, the more the
    conversation would reflect the corresponding sentiment (positive, negative or neutral).
